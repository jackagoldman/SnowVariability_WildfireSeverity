# Abstract

# Introduction

# Methods

*Study Area*

Our study was focused on the boreal shield ecoregion of Ontario.

Between 2008 and 2018, over a third of the wildfires that burned in the boreal forest of Canada
occurred in the Ontario's boreal shield ecoregion [@coops.etal2018].

*Data*

Remotely sensed burn severity maps were obtained from Google Earth Engine (GEE) at a 30m spatial
resolution based on fire perimeters for wildfires that burned between 2002-2019. Fire perimeters
were obtained from the Fire Disturbance Area database created and openly distributed by the
government of Ontario. We excluded all fires that were classified as prescribed burns in our
database. Fires that burn through a previously burnt area, referred to as reburns, may burn more or
less severely than fires that burnt in areas without recent history of previous wildfire
[@whitman.etal2019]. Therefore, we excluded all reburns in our data following preexisting protocol
outlined in [@whitman.etal2022]. Fires were removed if the overlap between polygons were greater
than the smallest area burned in our dataset (40ha) and the gap between the fires was equal to or
less than 26 years. We chose 26 years because that represents the earliest year in which we had fire
perimeter data for the first fire in our dataset.

Burn severity was measured using the relativized burn ratio (RBR). RBR is a Landsat-based fire
severity metric that represents the change in forest cover following a fire relative to the amount
of pre-fire vegetative cover rather than the absolute change. RBR is a more robust measure of burn
severity comparing to other Landsat-based approaches (e.g., rNBR) as it is more sensitive to
pre-fire values (41). Burn severity maps were generated from Landsat TM, ETM+ and OLI imagery
following a hybrid mean-compositing approach developed for the boreal region [@holsinger.etal2021]
that calculates the mean across a stack of pre-fire and post-fire imagery (see supplementary
materials).

Snow free date was determined using remotel

# Results

*Ontario boreal shield*

Across our entire study region, our structural equation model fit the data well with based on
good-of-fit static for both burn severity extremes (*C* = 14.177, *df* = 8 , *p* = 0.077) and median
burn severity (*C* = 14.177, *df* = 8 , *p* = 0.077) and revealed both direct and indirect
relationships between forest structural diversity, snow cover dynamics and burn severity. Our models
of median burn severity and burn severity extremes explained a high proportion of variance in both
snow free date *R*~2~ = 0.67 and snow free duration *R*~2~ = 0.84. Our models expalined a higher
proportion of variance in burn severity extremes *R*~2~ = 0.20 relative to our models of median burn
severity *R*~2~ = 0.12.

We found a significant and negative direct relationship between total aboveground biomass and snow
free date (fig 1a., Table 1). Stand age had a significant but positive direct relationship on snow
free date (fig 1a, Table 1). We did not find a significant relationship between percent canopy
closure and snow free date (fig 1a, Table 1). Topography, represented by terrain ruggedness index,
had a significant and negative direct relationship on snow free date (fig 1a, Table 1). We found a
significant but negative direct relationship of snow free date on snow free duration (fig 1a, Table
1). We found significant but positive direct relationships of both drought and stand age on snow
free duration, with a stronger direct relationship between drought and snow free duration (fig 1a,
Table 1). Drought and snow free duration had significant direct relationships on median burn
severity and burn severity extremes (fig 1a, Table 1). Drought had a negative relationship with burn
severity extremes but a positive relationship with median burn severity (fig 1a, Table 1). The
relationship between snow free duration and median burn severity was negative whereas the
relationship between burn severity extremes and snow free duration was positive (fig 1a, Table 1).
All forest structure metrics had no significant direct relationship with median burn severity but
all metrics had a significant direct relationship with burn severity extremes (Table 1). Stand age
and canopy closure had a negative relationship with burn severity extremes whereas total aboveground
biomass have a positive relationship (fig1a).

The indirect relationship between forest structural diversity and median burn severity - calculated
by multiplying the standardized regression coefficients of the path coefficients - showed that the
effects of stand age were stronger than canopy closure but similar to that of total aboveground
biomass, although stand age was positive whereas biomass was negative (fig 1b). In contrast, the
direct effect of canopy closure on median burn severity is stronger than both stand age and total
aboveground biomass, both of which had relatively low direct effects (fig 1b). More importantly, the
total causal effects of total aboveground biomass and canopy closure were similar and much strong
than stand age (fig 1b).

The indirect effects of forest structural diversity on burn severity extremes were strongest for
stand age compare to both total aboveground biomass and canopy closure (fig 1a). The indirect
relationships for canopy closure and total aboveground biomass were positive whereas stand age had a
negative indirect relationship with burn severity extremes. Critically, the total causal effects of
total aboveground biomass were stronger compared to both stand age and canopy closure (fig 1a).
Total aboveground biomass and canopy closure had positive indirect relationships and stand age had a
negative indirect relationship.

The indirect relationship of drought were strongest for burn severity extremes compared to median
burn severity. Yet, drought had an indirect positive relationship with burn severity extremes and
indirect negative relationship for median burn severity (fig1a, fig1b). The total cause effects of
drought were positive. In contrast, topography had a positive indirect relationship with both median
burn severity and burn severity extremes, yet these relationships were weaker than drought. However,
because the indirect relationship of drought on burn median burn severity was strongly negative and
the direct relationship was strongly positive, the strength and direction of these effects cancel
each other out and the total causal effects of drought on median burn severity to be weaker than
topography (fig 1b).

East vs. West Ontario

For western Ontario, our structural equation model fit the data better compared to the models for
all of Ontario based on the goodness-of-fit statistic for both burn severity extremes (*C* = 9.864,
*df* = 10, *p* = 0.453) and median burn severity (*C* = 9.864, *df* = 10, *p* = 0.453) .
